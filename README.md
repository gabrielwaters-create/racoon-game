# 🦝 Raccoon Game

A fun 2D platformer-in-progress where you play as a raccoon that can **jump** and **flip upside down** on passing spaceships. Built with **Python + Pygame** and custom-designed assets.  

This project is both a **personal game experiment** and a **demo of my coding skills** — Feel free to explore the code, run the game locally, and follow along with future updates.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- Control a raccoon character on a 2D platform with a custom background.  
- Jump with the **spacebar** and land on a moving spaceship.  
- When the raccoon lands on the spaceship’s path, it **flips upside down**.  
- Drop back down with **down arrow**.  
- Reset the game anytime with **Z**.  

*(More mechanics will be added soon — see Roadmap below!)*
